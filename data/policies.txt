POWER SECTOR:
Base year (2017): 60.7 GW installed - generation 254.5 TWh, of which 57% coal, 25% gas, 6% oil, 12% renewables (7% hydro + 5% geothermal)
Gas generation expected to increase by 80% by 2027, but share will decrease to 20%
Oil generation planned to go to almost 0 by 2023

By 2027: total + 9.5 GW in 2019 and + 56 GW by 2027, compared to 2017

35 GW plan (initially by 2019, now delayed till 2024): + 20.3 GW coal, + 13.6 gas, + 2.3 hydro, + 0.1 geothermal, + 0.2 other (from 2017) / gas to be 30.8 in 2027 
/ coal in RUPTL + 26.8 by 2029 (20.8 regular coal power plants, 6 CMM) / oil (and diesel) should in general decrease in power sector

Government aims at 23% renewables by 2030 (roughly half geothermal, half hydro), but they say it will be challenging, given small quota assigned in 35 GW plan 
Government expects complete access to electricity by 2024

Gas infrastructure investments (pipelines and distribution) by 14.2 billion USD foreseen by government by 2035

Gas reserves: 100.36 TSCF (trillion standard cubic feet) proven + 42.35 potential
Coal: 92% of reserves calorific value 0f 6100 kcal/kg; resources + reserves = 154 billion tonnes; annual production to be restricted to 400 Mtonnes?
rising price of coal? from 110USD/tonne up to maybe 127 (like in 2011) or even 140?
