With the current assumptions, the target of 11% reduction of CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 2030 compared to the BAU projection is met mostly by use of less energy intensive end use technologies and biofuels in transportation. This implies moderate electrification of all sectors. Mostly biomass, geothermal and hydro are invested in, to decarbonise electricity supply.
