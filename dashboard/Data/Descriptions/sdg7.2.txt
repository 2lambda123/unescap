With the current assumptions, the target of 11% reduction of CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 2030 compared to the BAU projection is met mostly by use of less energy intensive end use technologies and electric vehicles in transportation. The electricity supply is decarbonized by increased investments in hydro and geothermal and by replacement of coal with the less emission-intensive technology of Natural Gas fired power plants.
