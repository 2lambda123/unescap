To reach access to clean cooking facilities for all by 2030, biomass stoves and kerosene stoves are phased out. In a least-cost perspective, from the point of view of the entire energy system, the model suggests they are replaced mostly by Natural Gas stoves. This however implies extension of the gas distribution infrastructure. As the Natural Gas Stoves are much more efficient than the traditional biomass stoves, the total final consumption is expected to decrease (in contrast with the BAU scenario).
