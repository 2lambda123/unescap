To reach access to clean cooking facilities for all by 2030, biomass stoves and kerosene stoves are phased out. In a least-cost perspective, from the point of view of the entire energy system, the model suggests they are replaced mostly by electric stoves. The Total Final Energy Consumption of the sector decreases, since electric stoves are much more efficient than biomass stoves. A contribution also from solar thermal cookers and, to a lesser extent, of Natural Gas stoves is seen, too. The penetration of Natural Gas stoves highly depends on the assumed price for gas distribution infrastructure.
