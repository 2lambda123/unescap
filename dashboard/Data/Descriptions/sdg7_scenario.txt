Modified from the Current Policies scenario. Furthermore, all SDG7 targets are added: 
SDG7.1 targets of universal electrification, SDG7.2 targets of access to clean cooking (phase out of biomass and kerosene stoves by 2030) 
and SDG7.3 targets of energy efficiency (reduction of energy intensity in residential and commercial electricity uses 
+ deeper fuel shift allowed in transportation + deeper reduction of coal use in industry).
