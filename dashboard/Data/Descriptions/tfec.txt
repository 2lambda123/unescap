In the Current Policies and SDG7 scenarios, the TFEC growth is projected to be significantly lower than in the BAU scenario. This is mainly due to shift to
more efficient cooking and water heating technologies in the residential sector and to shift to more efficient transportation modes. In the SDG7 scenario, also energy efficiency measures in the residential and commercial sectors contribute to a lower increase of TFEC. More scenarios can be analyzed, where the user may introduce also deeper fuel shifts in industry (e.g. replacement of coal in certain segments of industry) and different modal shifts in transportation than those considered in the current policies.
