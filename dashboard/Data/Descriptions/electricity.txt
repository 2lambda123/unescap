The electricity demand (and consequently the supply) is projected to be lower in the Current Policies and SDG7 scenario. This depends on the model assumptions and could change with different assumptions. The reason in this case is that both in residential and industrial sector a much higher share of the final service demands is met by Natural Gas. At the same time, in transportation, a much higher share of the final service demands is met with biofuels.
