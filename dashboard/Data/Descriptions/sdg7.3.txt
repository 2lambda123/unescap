Energy efficiency measures in the residential and commercial sector contribute to a lower increase of the TFEC in the SDG7 scenario. Amongst the energy efficiency measures, any reducing the energy intensity in electricity uses are considered (e.g. replacement of inefficient appliances).
However, in the model, also measures going in the direction of future improvements of the indicator for SDG7.3 are included: that is, fuel shifts in the transportation and industry sector. The user can make assumptions on such shifts, thanks to the high disaggregation of the end use services in both sectors (e.g. deeper replacement of coal in chemical and fertilizer industrial processes; modal shifts in transportation, from cars and motorcycles to public transportation).
