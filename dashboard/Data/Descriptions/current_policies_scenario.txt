Modified from the BAU scenario. All base assumptions as in this scenario. 
In addition, a target of minimum renewable energy share in the total primary energy supply is added, 
sufficient to allow for 11% decrease of CO2 emissions by the energy sector by 2030, according to the unconditional NDCs of Indonesia. 
Renewable energies included in the target are: biofuels for transportation, hydro, geothermal, solar PV, wind and biomass for power generation, 
solar thermal for residential. Other current policies include: 
reduction of use of coal in various industrial processes, reduction of use of fossil fuels in transportation and the 35 GW plan for the power sector.
