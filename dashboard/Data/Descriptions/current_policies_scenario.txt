Modified from the BAU scenario. All base assumptions as in this scenario. In addition, a target of 11% decrease of CO2 emissions by the energy sector by 2030 compared to the BAU scenario is set, according to the unconditional NDCs of Indonesia. Other policy orientations of the National Energy Plan are considered, such as the intention of decreasing the dependence on oil and optimizing the use of Natural Gas. In the transportation sector, it is assumed that by 2050 7.5% (x 2) of the car transportation and 7.5% (x 2) of the motorcycle transportation (both in terms of passenger-km) compared to projected demand in the BAU scenario shift towards public bus and train transportation. Likewise, it is assumed that 7.5% of the truck transportation (in terms of tonnes-km) shifts to freight train transportation by 2050.
